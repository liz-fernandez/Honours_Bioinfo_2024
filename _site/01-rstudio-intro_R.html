<h2 id="before-starting-the-workshop">Before Starting The Workshop</h2>

<p>Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">Download and install the latest version of R here</a></li>

<h2 id="why-use-r-and-r-studio">Why use R and R studio?</h2>

<p>Welcome to the R portion of the Software Carpentry workshop!</p>

<p>Science is a multi-step process: once you’ve designed an experiment and collected
data, the real fun begins with analysis! Throughout this lesson, we’re going to teach you some of the fundamentals of the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for scientific projects that will make your life easier.</p>

<p>Although we could use a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel or Google sheets to analyze our data, these tools are limited in their flexibility and accessibility. Critically, they also are difficult to share steps which explore and change the raw data, which is key to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285">“reproducible” research</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, this lesson will teach you how to begin exploring your data using R and RStudio. The R program is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and is a freely-available where you downloaded it above. To run R, all you need is the R program.</p>

<p>However, to make using R easier, we will use the program RStudio, which we also downloaded above. RStudio is a free, open-source, Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms (including
on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. This example starts with a dataset from <a href="https://www.gapminder.org">gapminder.org</a> containing population information for many
countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the population for
Senegal? Can you calculate the average income for countries on the continent of Asia?
By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations
for all of these countries in under a minute!</p>

<p><strong>Basic layout</strong></p>

<p>When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)</li>
  <li>Environment/History/Connections (tabbed in upper right)</li>
  <li>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="fig/01-rstudio.png" alt="" />{alt=’RStudio layout’}</p>

<p>Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.</p>

<p><img src="fig/01-rstudio-script.png" alt="" />{alt=’RStudio layout with .R file open’}</p>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout</p>

<h2 id="r-scripts">R scripts</h2>

<p>Any commands that you write in the R console can be saved to a file
to be re-run again.  Files containing R code to be ran in this way are
called R scripts.  R scripts have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.R</code> at the end of their names to
let you know what they are.</p>

<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>

<h2 id="workflow-within-rstudio">Workflow within RStudio</h2>

<p>There are two main ways one can work within RStudio:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
  a .R file to run later.
    <ul>
      <li>This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.</li>
      <li>It quickly becomes laborious</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Start writing in a .R file and use RStudio’s short cut keys for the Run command
  to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
  interactive R console.
    <ul>
      <li>This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later</li>
      <li>You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
 or using R’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source()</code>  function.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout</p>

<h2 id="tip-running-segments-of-your-code">Tip: Running segments of your code</h2>

<p>RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
current line, you can</p>

<ol>
  <li>click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run</code> button above the editor panel, or</li>
  <li>select “Run Lines” from the “Code” menu, or</li>
  <li>hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux
  or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
  (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
  the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run</code>.
  If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
  there is no need to reselect the section and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run</code>, you can use the next button
  along, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Re-run the previous region</code>. This will run the previous code block
  including the modifications you have made.</li>
</ol>

<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-r">Introduction to R</h2>

<p>Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> in your command-line environment.</p>

<p>The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a “&gt;” and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a “Read, evaluate,
print loop”: you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.</p>

<h2 id="using-r-as-a-calculator">Using R as a calculator</h2>

<p>The simplest thing you could do with R is to do arithmetic:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1 + 100
</code></pre>

<p>And R will print out the answer, with a preceding “[1]”. [1] is the index of
the first element of the line being printed in the console. For more information
on indexing vectors, see <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/06-data-subsetting/index.html">Episode 6: Subsetting Data</a>.</p>

<p>If you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it. If you are familiar with Unix Shell’s bash, you may recognize this behavior from bash.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<pre><code class="language-output">+
</code></pre>

<p>Any time you hit return and the R session shows a “+” instead of a “&gt;”, it
means it’s waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> and RStudio will give you back the “&gt;” prompt.</p>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout</p>

<h2 id="tip-canceling-commands">Tip: Canceling commands</h2>

<p>If you’re using R from the command line instead of from within RStudio,
you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>
to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!</p>

<p>Canceling a command isn’t only useful for killing incomplete commands:
you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it’s
taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you’re
currently writing.</p>

<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>

<p>When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.</p>

<p>From highest to lowest precedence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parentheses: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">)</code></li>
  <li>Exponents: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**</code></li>
  <li>Multiply: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code></li>
  <li>Divide: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code></li>
  <li>Add: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code></li>
  <li>Subtract: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code></li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">3 + 5 * 2
</code></pre>

<p>Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">(3 + 5) * 2
</code></pre>

<p>This can get unwieldy when not needed, but clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r}
2/10000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which is shorthand for “multiplied by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10^XX</code>”. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2e-4</code>
is shorthand for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2 * 10^(-4)</code>.</p>

<p>You can write numbers in scientific notation too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
</code></pre>

<h2 id="mathematical-functions">Mathematical functions</h2>

<p>R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we can type its name, followed by open and closing parentheses.
Functions take arguments as inputs, anything we type inside the parentheses of a function is considered an argument. Depending on the function, the number of arguments can vary from none to multiple. For example:</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd() #returns an absolute filepath</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
doesn't require an argument, whereas for the next set of mathematical functions we will need to supply the function a value in order to compute the result.

```{r}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
</code></pre></div></div>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">log(1)  # natural logarithm
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
</code></pre>

<p>Don’t worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function’s name, use the tab completion in RStudio.</p>

<p>This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it
has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily
look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they
take.</p>

<p>Typing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. When using RStudio, this will open the ‘Help’ pane;
if using R in the terminal, the help page will open in your browser.
The help page will include a detailed description of the command and
how it works. Scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually
show a collection of code examples which illustrate command usage.
We’ll go through an example later.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-things">Comparing things</h2>

<p>We can also do comparisons in R:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1 &lt; 2  # less than
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1 &lt;= 1  # less than or equal to
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1 &gt; 0  # greater than
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1 &gt;= -9 # greater than or equal to
</code></pre>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout</p>

<h2 id="tip-comparing-numbers">Tip: Comparing Numbers</h2>

<p>A word of warning about comparing numbers: you should
never use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code> to compare two numbers unless they are
integers (a data type which can specifically represent
only whole numbers).</p>

<p>Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a
certain degree of precision, so two numbers which look
the same when printed out by R, may actually have
different underlying representations and therefore be
different by a small margin of error (called Machine
numeric tolerance).</p>

<p>Instead you should use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all.equal</code> function.</p>

<p>Further reading: <a href="https://floating-point-gui.de/">http://floating-point-gui.de/</a></p>

<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>

<h2 id="variables-and-assignment">Variables and assignment</h2>

<p>We can store values in variables using the assignment operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;-</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">x &lt;- 1/40
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a <strong>variable</strong>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> now contains the <strong>value</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.025</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">x
</code></pre>

<p>More precisely, the stored value is a <em>decimal approximation</em> of
this fraction called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point">floating point number</a>.</p>

<p>Look for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Environment</code> tab in the top right panel of RStudio, and you will see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and its value
have appeared. Our variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">log(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice also that variables can be reassigned:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">x &lt;- 100
</code></pre>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> used to contain the value 0.025 and now it has the value 100.</p>

<p>Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">x &lt;- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y &lt;- x * 2
</code></pre>

<p>The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is <em>fully evaluated</em> before the assignment occurs.</p>

<p>Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods but no spaces. They
must start with a letter or a period followed by a letter (they cannot start with a number nor an underscore).
Variables beginning with a period are hidden variables.
Different people use different conventions for long variable names, these include</p>

<ul>
  <li>periods.between.words</li>
  <li>underscores_between_words</li>
  <li>camelCaseToSeparateWords</li>
</ul>

<p>What you use is up to you, but <strong>be consistent</strong>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> operator for assignment:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">x = 1/40
</code></pre>

<p>But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
<strong>be consistent</strong> with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;-</code> than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;-</code>.</p>

<h2 id="vectorization">Vectorization</h2>

<p>One final thing to be aware of is that R is <em>vectorized</em>, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and
mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the
same data type. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">1:5
2^(1:5)
x &lt;- 1:5
2^x
</code></pre>

<p>This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.</p>

<h2 id="managing-your-environment">Managing your environment</h2>

<p>There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls()</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# If `ls()` is left to run by itself when rendering this Rmd document (as would
# happen if the code chunk above was evaluated), the output would contain extra
# items ("args", "dest_md", "op", "src_md") that people following the lesson
# would not see in their own session.
#
# This probably comes from the way the md episodes are generated when the
# lesson website is built. The solution below uses a temporary environment to
# mimick what the learners should observe when running `ls()` on their
# machines.

temp.env &lt;- new.env()
temp.env$x &lt;- x
temp.env$y &lt;- y
ls(temp.env)
rm(temp.env)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout</p>

<h2 id="tip-hidden-objects">Tip: hidden objects</h2>

<p>Like in the shell, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> will hide any variables or functions starting
with a “.” by default. To list all objects, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls(all.names=TRUE)</code>
instead</p>

<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>

<p>Note here that we didn’t give any arguments to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.</p>

<p>If we type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> by itself, R prints a bunch of code instead of a listing of objects.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">ls
</code></pre>

<p>What’s going on here?</p>

<p>Like everything in R, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> is the name of an object, and entering the name of
an object by itself prints the contents of the object. The object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> that we
created earlier contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r x</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">x
</code></pre>

<p>The object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> contains the R code that makes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> function work! We’ll talk
more about how functions work and start writing our own later.</p>

<p>You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code> to delete objects you no longer need:</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case we’ve combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.</p>

<p>In this case we’ve specified that the results of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> should be used for the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list</code> argument in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code>. When assigning values to arguments by name, you <em>must</em>
use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> operator!!</p>

<p>If instead we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;-</code>, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:</p>

<p>```{r, error=TRUE}
rm(list &lt;- ls())</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors

Pay attention when R does something unexpected! Errors, like above,
are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the
other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably
hasn't worked as expected.

In both cases, the message that R prints out usually give you clues
how to fix a problem.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

- You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
- You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
- You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
- You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
- You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages tab of the lower right panel in RStudio. Clicking on this tab will display all of the installed packages with a checkbox next to them. If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded and if it is empty, the package is not loaded. Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to detach that package.

Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.

An alternate solution, to install multiple packages with a single `install.packages()` command is:

```{r ch5-sol2, eval=FALSE}

<p>When installing ggplot2, it may be required for some users to use the dependencies flag as a result of lazy loading affecting the install. This suggestion is not tied to any known bug discussion, and is advised based off instructor feedback/experience in resolving stochastic occurences of errors identified through delivery of this workshop:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{r ch5-sol3, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
</code></p>
