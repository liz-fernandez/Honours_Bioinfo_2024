## Reading Help Files

R, and every package, provide help files for functions. The general syntax to search for help on any
function, "function\_name", from a specific function that is in a package loaded into your
namespace (your interactive R session) is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?function_name
help(function_name)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example take a look at the help file for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write.table()</code>, we will be using a similar function in an upcoming episode.</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
?write.table()</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
This will load up a help page in RStudio (or as plain text in R itself).

Each help page is broken down into sections:

- Description: An extended description of what the function does.
- Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values (which can be changed).
- Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
- Details: Any important details to be aware of.
- Value: The data the function returns.
- See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
- Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

Different functions might have different sections, but these are the main ones you should be aware of.

Notice how related functions might call for the same help file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?write.table()
?write.csv()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because these functions have very similar applicability and often share the same arguments as inputs to the function, so package authors often choose to document them together in a single help file.</p>

<h2 id="tip-running-examples">Tip: Running Examples</h2>

<p>From within the function help page, you can highlight code in the
Examples and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> to run it in
RStudio console. This gives you a quick way to get a feel for
how a function works.</p>

<h2 id="tip-reading-help-files">Tip: Reading Help Files</h2>

<p>One of the most daunting aspects of R is the large number of functions
available. It would be prohibitive, if not impossible to remember the
correct usage for every function you use. Luckily, using the help files
means you don’t have to remember that!</p>

<h2 id="special-operators">Special Operators</h2>

<p>To seek help on special operators, use quotes or backticks:</p>

## Getting Help with Packages

Many packages come with "vignettes": tutorials and extended example documentation.
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages;
`vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for
`package-name`, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.

If a package doesn't have any vignettes, you can usually find help by typing
`help("package-name")`.

RStudio also has a set of excellent
[cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for many packages.

## When You Remember Part of the Function Name

If you're not sure what package a function is in or how it's specifically spelled, you can do a fuzzy search:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??function_name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A fuzzy search is when you search for an approximate string match. For example, you may remember that the function
to set your working directory includes “set” in its name. You can do a fuzzy search to help you identify the function:</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
??set</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
## When You Have No Idea Where to Begin

If you don't know what function or package you need to use
[CRAN Task Views](https://cran.at.r-project.org/web/views)
is a specially maintained list of packages grouped into
fields. This can be a good starting point.

## When Your Code Doesn't Work: Seeking Help from Your Peers

If you're having trouble using a function, 9 times out of 10,
the answers you seek have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). You can search using
the `[r]` tag. Please make sure to see their page on
[how to ask a good question.](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

If you can't find the answer, there are a few useful functions to
help you ask your peers:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?dput
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Will dump the data you’re working with into a format that can
be copied and pasted by others into their own R session.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">sessionInfo()
</code></pre>

<p>Will print out your current version of R, as well as any packages you
have loaded. This can be useful for others to help reproduce and debug
your issue.</p>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge</p>

<h2 id="challenge-1">Challenge 1</h2>

<p>Look at the help page for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code> function. What kind of vector do you
expect will be created if you evaluate the following:</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
c(1, 2, 3)
c(‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’)
c(1, 2, ‘f’)</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 1

The `c()` function creates a vector, in which all elements are of the
same type. In the first case, the elements are numeric, in the
second, they are characters, and in the third they are also characters:
the numeric values are "coerced" to be characters.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 2

Look at the help for the `paste` function. You will need to use it later.
What's the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 2

To look at the help for the `paste()` function, use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help("paste")
?paste
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sep</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collapse</code> is a little
tricky. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paste</code> function accepts any number of arguments, each of which
can be a vector of any length. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sep</code> argument specifies the string
used between concatenated terms — by default, a space. The result is a
vector as long as the longest argument supplied to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paste</code>. In contrast,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collapse</code> specifies that after concatenation the elements are <em>collapsed</em>
together using the given separator, the result being a single string.</p>

<p>It is important to call the arguments explicitly by typing out the argument
name e.g <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sep = ","</code> so the function understands to use the “,” as a
separator and not a term to concatenate.
e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">paste(c("a","b"), "c")
paste(c("a","b"), "c", ",")
paste(c("a","b"), "c", sep = ",")
paste(c("a","b"), "c", collapse = "|")
paste(c("a","b"), "c", sep = ",", collapse = "|")
</code></pre>

<p>(For more information,
scroll to the bottom of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?paste</code> help page and look at the
examples, or try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example('paste')</code>.)</p>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>

<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge</p>

<h2 id="challenge-3">Challenge 3</h2>

<p>Use help to find a function (and its associated parameters) that you could
use to load data from a tabular file in which columns are delimited with “\t”
(tab) and the decimal point is a “.” (period). This check for decimal
separator is important, especially if you are working with international
colleagues, because different countries have different conventions for the
decimal point (i.e. comma vs period).
Hint: use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">??"read table"</code> to look up functions related to reading in tabular data.</p>

<p>:::::::::::::::  solution</p>

<h2 id="solution-to-challenge-3">Solution to Challenge 3</h2>

<p>The standard R function for reading tab-delimited files with a period
decimal separator is read.delim(). You can also do this with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read.table(file, sep="\t")</code> (the period is the <em>default</em> decimal
separator for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read.table()</code>), although you may have to change
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comment.char</code> argument as well if your data file contains
hash (#) characters.</p>
